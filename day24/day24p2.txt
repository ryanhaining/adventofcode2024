I created a .dot file and rendered with graphviz to look for mistakes.

Verification by adding the x+y and comparing to the z value the program produced.

Seeing which bits were wrong, and what looked structurally different in graphviz meant I could look at what operations weren't correct in the add logic.

No code to add here.
